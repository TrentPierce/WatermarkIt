# WatermarkIt
A simple web app to watermark videos using ffmpeg and Node.js.


This is essentially a website created to simplify adding a text watermark to videos. 

You can download the repository and click on the index.html to open the web page.
To start the server on your machine, just open a powershell window in the root project folder and type "node server.js" and press enter. 

On the web page just choose a video and type the text you want to watermark it with. The watermarked video will be output to the "Uploads" folder in the project directory.

The web page will show a video and a download link, but they do not currently work. I plan to update them soon to fix that issue.
